# RegIntel: A Free and Public Data-Driven Python Library for Regulatory Risk Intelligence  

## üß≠ Project Purpose

**RegIntel** (short for ‚ÄúRegulatory Intelligence‚Äù) is a fully open-source, transparent Python library designed for:

- üåç **Monitoring global drug regulations** (using only freely available data)
- üíä **Tracking pharmaceutical molecule submissions**
- üìä **Calculating regulatory & development risks**
- üß† **Finding historical analogs using similarity analysis**

Built for **R&D teams, Regulatory Affairs, Pharmacovigilance, Compliance, and Internal Audit**, RegIntel offers a reproducible, version-controlled, and explainable toolkit to:
- Mitigate unexpected regulatory failure
- Analyze regional risk patterns over time
- Anticipate risks based on past molecule precedents
- Serve as a computational audit trail

---

## üí° Why RegIntel? The Problem It Solves

Pharmaceutical organizations are overwhelmed by regulatory complexity:

- Rules and guidance are evolving rapidly across regions (FDA, EMA, Swissmedic, PMDA, etc.)
- Public knowledge of submissions and failures is fragmented and reactive
- Many regulatory tools today require proprietary data or expensive licenses
- Audit departments lack transparent methods to trace decisions or identify patterns in regulatory failures

RegIntel solves this by:
- Tapping into **only public and free regulatory sources**
- **Structuring global data over time**, per molecule, per authority
- **Scoring and visualizing risk levels** for current and planned submissions
- **Comparing new molecules** against thousands of documented submission paths

## üîç Risk Estimation Methodology

The **RiskEngine** module produces robust, interpretable regulatory risk scores by combining statistical analysis, domain knowledge, and machine learning trained exclusively on public data:

### Key Risk Factors Considered

| Factor                        | Description                                                                                   | Source / Data Type               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Regulatory Environment Volatility** | Frequency and magnitude of recent regulatory changes/warnings in the drug‚Äôs region & class   | OpenFDA change logs, EMA updates |
| **Historical Approval Timelines**      | Average and variance of approval/review times for similar molecules & indications           | Drugs@FDA datasets, EPAR records |
| **Outcome Frequencies**                | Proportion of approvals, withdrawals, major label changes historically in the molecule‚Äôs class | FDA, EMA, PharmNet.Bund public summaries |
| **Chemical/Indication Complexity**     | Indicators of molecule novelty, multi-target profiles, rare indications synthesized from public databases | ChEMBL, PubChem classifications  |
| **Submission Completeness Proxy**      | Inferred from timing and completeness of publicly available submission metadata               | Submission timestamps, update records |

### Approach

- **Feature Extraction:** Automated extraction of numerical and categorical features from dynamic public datasets.
- **Supervised Learning:** Use of gradient-boosted tree models (`XGBoost`) trained on historical submission outcomes (approved/rejected/withdrawn), leveraging open historic data only.
- **Rule-based Supplement:** Handcrafted domain rules to complement ML models where data is sparse.
- **Explainability:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or similar tools highlight individual risk factor contributions.
- **Calibration:** Scores normalized between 0 (low risk) and 1 (high risk) for intuitive interpretation.

## üîÑ Similarity Matching Methodology

The **SimilarityMatcher** evaluates how closely a new molecule submission aligns with historic cases by:

### Multi-Dimensional Similarity Factors

| Dimension                  | Description                                         | Data & Techniques                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Chemical Structure**      | Fingerprints and substructure matching of molecule  | Open-source fingerprints (MACCS, ECFP) from ChEMBL, PubChem |
| **Therapeutic Indication**  | Standardized indication codes using open ontologies | MeSH, SNOMED CT standard vocabularies |
| **Regulatory Pathway Type** | NDA, ANDA, accelerated approval, orphan drug status | Extraction from public submission metadata |
| **Submission & Outcome Documents** | NLP embeddings of publicly available assessment reports, labeling changes | Sentence-BERT or similar transformer models on EPARs, PDPs, and FDA labels |
| **Sponsor & Market Info**   | Publicly known sponsor type, country, approval status | Public sponsorship data, marketing authorizations |

### Techniques

- Use of **chemical similarity** metrics (Tanimoto, Dice coefficients) for structure comparison.
- **Textual embeddings and semantic search** on regulatory documents and public submission narratives.
- **Clustering and nearest-neighbor search** (e.g., FAISS) for fast identification of top historical matches.
- Composite scoring that balances chemical, textual, and regulatory metadata similarity.

---

## üìà Combined Use

- **Risk scores are contextualized by similarity matches**, enabling users to:
  - Benchmark pipeline molecules against historically risky or smooth-path analogs.
  - Gain narrative insights from closest historical regulatory decisions.
